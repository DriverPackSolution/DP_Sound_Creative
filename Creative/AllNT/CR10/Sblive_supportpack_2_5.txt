This occurs due to a memory addressing issue that cannot be fixed.

Simply use the "Creative SoundFont Synthesizer", that has the same functionality but uses software processing.


Creative Software Synthesizer is mute on Windows XP with more than 2GB of RAM

For both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Windows XP, simply change the cache mode or change the maximum amount of memory for Soundfonts.


Fix for low volume on Windows 8 / 7 / Vista (only for 2/2. Speakers or Headphones)

(*) If the current speaker configuration is 4.1 or 5.1 Speakers, first change it to 2/2.1 mode, then finally change it to Headphones, otherwise the effects won't work.

Facts about the methods:

- "Music - Normalizer" gives the highest volume.
- "Flat" gives an average volume increase and you can tweak the EQ if you want to.
- Both methods use the Emu0k DSP's hardware engine, not relying on your CPU.

1) Selecting an Special FX preset named "Music - Normalizer"

- Open "Audio Console".
- In the EAX tab, select "Special FX" then choose "Music - Normalizer"

2) Creating an EQ preset named "Flat"

- Open "Creative EAX Settings".
- Select EQ and choose "(No effect)"
- Type in a new name "Flat" (or whatever you like)
- Add a "Parametric Equalizer" effect by clicking the "Add..." button.
- Set the "Type" to "Creative Equalizer 4".
- Make sure the Parametric Equalizer amount is set to its maximum (0.0 dB).
- Click on the "Save environment" button.
